            <p>Everlane sells high-end, eco-conscious fashion and accessories for men and women. Their product descriptions match their style: sassy, yet classy. Here’s a look at The Day Heel that retails for $145 online:[*]What I love about Everlane and the way they approach describing this heel (and other products) is that they speak in the language of their customers.Using phrases like “All. Damn. Day.” and “take your usual size” makes shoppers feel as if they were talking to their friends, not a business.</p>
